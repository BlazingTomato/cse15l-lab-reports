# Getting into your Remote Access account of r CSE15L
## Step 1: Installing VSCode

If you're using the lab computers, VScode should already be installed. Simply press Windows key, then search for VSCode as shown below.

If not, Vscode has a good tutorial on how to install and set up VSCode [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview). P.S. If you're looking for a cool dark color theme, I recommend [Palenight Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whizkydee.material-palenight-theme).
